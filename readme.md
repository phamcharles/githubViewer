# Welcome to Github Viewer! It is such an original name!

All code written in this repository is my own, created from an empty folder.

*To get started*
1. clone the repository https://github.com/phamcharles/githubViewer
2. run command 'npm install'
3. run command 'npm start'

Apologies in advance for not setting up a production server.

*Todos:*
- add server
- add routing
- add prod build
- add brand/general basic theme styles
- add tests
- ensure all error handling degrades gracefully
- clean up table list styles
- look into caching mechanisms
